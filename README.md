# Better Nutritionists System: A Smart Way to Connect Clients with Certified Nutritionists.

A naive concept to streamline the process of allowing certified nutritionists to sell their meal plans and connect with potential clientele. 

The aim of this system is to automate the process of nutritionists getting their diet and meal plans to the online catalog as seamlessly as possible.

## Geany Project Set-up

Geany project-files (`*.geany`) are in the `.gitignore` for the entire repository, since they have filesystem-specific paths that would break as they were moved from one developer's local environment to another. Instructions for (re-) creating those projects are provided for each.

### Better Nutritionists System  -- `better_nutritionists_system.geany`

Over-arching project that encompasses *all* of the component projects. It can be re-created by launching Geany, then using Project -> New and providing:

* *Name:* Better Nutritionists System
* *Filename:* `[path-to-git-repo]/better_nutritionists_system/better_nutritionists_sys.geany`
* *Base path:*  `[path-to-git-repo]/better_nutritionists_sys`
